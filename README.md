# ArtaCore Query Creator
A small utility to generate SQL queries for import in the ArtaCore server.

For example, the creation of .SQL queries to populate the NPC_VENDOR table with item IDs, being able to copy and paste a list of them (from XLS/Google Spreadsheet or even a notepad list), selecting the Vendor ID from a dropdown menu and generating a SQL (with preview) file that will import it in the correct Table.

It could also lookup the IDs on https://wotlk.evowow.com in order to show up the real item names.
